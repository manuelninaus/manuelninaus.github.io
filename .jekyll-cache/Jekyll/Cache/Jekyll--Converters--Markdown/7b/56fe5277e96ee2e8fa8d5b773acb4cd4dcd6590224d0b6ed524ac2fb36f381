<p>It is assumed that serious games influences learning in 2 ways, by
changing cognitive processes and by affecting motivation. However, until
now research has shown little evidence for these assumptions. We used
meta-analytic techniques to investigate whether serious games are more
effective in terms of learning and more motivating than conventional
instruction methods (learning: <em>k</em> = 77, <em>N</em> = 5,547; motivation: <em>k</em> =
31, <em>N</em> = 2,216).</p>

<p>Consistent with our hypotheses, serious games were found to be more
effective in terms of learning (d = 0.29, p &lt; .01) and retention (<em>d</em> =
0.36, *p** &lt; .01), but they were <em>*not more motivating** (</em>d* =
0.26, *p** &gt; .05) than conventional instruction methods.</p>

<p>Additional moderator analyses on the learning effects revealed that
learners in serious games learned more, relative to those taught with
conventional instruction methods, when the game was supplemented with
other instruction methods, when multiple training sessions were
involved, and when players worked in groups.</p>

<h2 id="github-documents">GitHub Documents</h2>

<p>This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the <strong>Knit</strong> button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.</p>

<h2 id="including-code">Including Code</h2>

<p>You can include R code in the document as follows:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">summary</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cars</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00

##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="including-plots">Including Plots</h2>

<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>

<p><img src="2022-03-15-meta-game-wouters_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png" alt="" /><!-- --></p>

<p>Note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo = FALSE</code> parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.</p>
